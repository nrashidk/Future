Purpose (non-proprietary)

Estimate preferences on Kolb’s two axes:

CE–AC: Concrete Experience (CE) ↔ Abstract Conceptualization (AC)

RO–AE: Reflective Observation (RO) ↔ Active Experimentation (AE)

Output: CE, RO, AC, AE subscale scores; X = AC−CE; Y = AE−RO; quadrant label (Diverging / Assimilating / Converging / Accommodating); tailored guidance.

Format

24 items; 6 per subscale (CE, RO, AC, AE).

Likert: 1=Strongly disagree … 5=Strongly agree

Reverse-keyed items marked (R).

Concrete Experience (CE)

I learn best when I can observe real situations up close.

I like to collect concrete examples before forming an opinion.

Hands-on exposure helps me “get it” faster.

I prefer stories and case studies to abstract descriptions.

I’m most confident after seeing it in action.

I feel lost when learning without practical context.

Reflective Observation (RO)
7. I need quiet time to review what happened before deciding.
8. I often journal or take notes to process experiences.
9. I like to compare multiple perspectives before acting.
10. I prefer to watch first, then try.
11. I often ask clarifying questions before moving on.
12. I look for patterns across different experiences.

Abstract Conceptualization (AC)
13. I enjoy building models or frameworks to explain things.
14. I feel confident when I can define the underlying principles.
15. I often turn experiences into general rules.
16. I prefer logic and structure over examples.
17. I learn well from diagrams or formal explanations.
18. I like to test an idea against a theory.

Active Experimentation (AE)
19. I prefer to try things quickly rather than over-analyze.
20. I like to run small experiments to learn what works.
21. I’m comfortable making changes on the fly.
22. I often propose pilots to move from talk to action.
23. I iterate publicly, even if it’s not perfect.
24. I learn best when I can apply something immediately.

Optional reverse-keying (for response validity): convert 2–3 items to (R) by re-wording (e.g., “I struggle to learn from concrete examples” (R)). If you do that, remember to invert 1→5, 2→4, 3→3, 4→2, 5→1 on those items.

Scoring

Subscale raw scores: sum of each subscale’s 6 items (range 6–30).

Axes:

X = AC − CE (positive = abstract preference)

Y = AE − RO (positive = active preference)

Quadrant:

X≥0 & Y≥0 → Converging

X<0 & Y≥0 → Accommodating

X≥0 & Y<0 → Assimilating

X<0 & Y<0 → Diverging

Normalization (optional)

Convert raw to 0–100: norm = (raw−6) / (30−6) * 100.

Keep raw for axis computation; normalization is just for charts.

Response-quality checks

Straight-lining: ≥80% identical responses → flag low_variance.

Inconsistency pair (optional): include one (R) item; if both logically clash (e.g., AC vs CE extreme), flag inconsistency.

Completion time: < ~90s for 24 items → flag too_fast.
