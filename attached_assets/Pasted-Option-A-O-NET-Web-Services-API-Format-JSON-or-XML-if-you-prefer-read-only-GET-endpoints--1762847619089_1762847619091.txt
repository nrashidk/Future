Option A — O*NET Web Services (API)

Format: JSON (or XML if you prefer); read-only GET endpoints.

Access: free registration → API key (HTTP Basic).

How to request JSON: send header Accept: application/json. The API defaults to XML otherwise.

Relevant endpoints: the “O*NET OnLine services → Occupation report → Summary/details → Work Values” endpoints return up to the top three work value descriptors for an occupation; there are also “Related occupations for Work Values” endpoints.

Example call (structure):

GET https://services.onetcenter.org/ws/online/occupations/{onet_code}/summary/work_values
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Basic {your_key}


You’ll receive JSON you can parse directly (or XML if you set no Accept header).

When to use: quick lookups at runtime (low bandwidth, always-current to the live database version noted by the service).

Option B — Download the O*NET Database

Formats available: Excel, Text (tab-delimited; CSV-like), and SQL dumps for MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle (you can also import to SQLite or Postgres). 
O*NET Resource Center

Table: work_values (maps O*NET-SOC occupations to Work Values ratings). The data dictionary documents columns (e.g., scale, mean “EX” extent, “VH” high-point indices).

Important note: O*NET 30.0 indicates Work Values are no longer updated/displayed on the websites, though downloadable files remain available from the database page; other content areas (e.g., Work Styles, Work Activities) continue to update. If you need the latest snapshot, pull from the Database page (not just the website UI).

Parsing tips

Text/Excel: treat “Text” as tab-delimited CSV; Excel is .xlsx; both are straightforward to ingest. 
O*NET Resource Center

SQL dumps: load the work_values table into your DB; join by O*NET-SOC code to your occupation list.

Licensing / reuse

O*NET Web Services & most database content are under CC BY 4.0—reuse allowed with attribution; check the license page and note exceptions listed for a few external data sources.

Recommended integration pattern for your build

Bulk/offline: import the work_values table from the downloadable database (Text/Excel/SQL). This gives you full coverage and stable joins for your CVQ mapping.

Runtime enrichments: use Web Services to fetch per-occupation summaries (e.g., top Work Values, Interests, etc.) as needed—JSON parsing is trivial and officially supported
