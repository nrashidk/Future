I built you a complete, drop-in Holland Code (RIASEC) Career Quiz as a single React component—scoring, flags, suggestions, and all.

Open the canvas “RIASEC (Holland Code) Career Quiz – React component” to grab the code.

What’s included

30 original items (5 per R/I/A/S/E/C), Likert 1–5.

Client-side scoring → raw (5–25) and normalized (0–100) per theme.

Top-3 code (e.g., “IAS”), explanation blurbs, and tailored suggestions (environments, roles, study areas, questions).

Response-quality checks: low variance, too fast, incomplete.

Keyboard-accessible Likert radios, Tailwind styling, framer-motion polish.

LocalStorage draft-save; JSON export of results.

Optional onSubmit(result) prop for saving to your backend.

How the scoring works (transparent)

Each theme (R/I/A/S/E/C) has 5 items.

Convert each answer to a 1–5 value (reverse-key if marked).

Raw score per theme = sum of its 5 items → 5–25.

Normalize to 0–100 with:
(raw − 5) / 20 * 100.

Ranking: sort themes by normalized score; take top 3 for the code.

Flags:

lowVariance if ≥80% of answers are identical

tooFast if total time < 2.5s per item

incomplete if any item missing

How to embed in your site (React + Vite)

Drop the file anywhere in your client (e.g., src/components/RiasecQuiz.tsx).

Import and route:

import RiasecQuiz from "@/components/RiasecQuiz";

export default function RiasecPage() {
  return <RiasecQuiz onSubmit={(r)=>fetch("/api/riasec",{method:"POST",headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'},body:JSON.stringify(r)})} />;
}


Add a nav link to /riasec.

Tailwind/shadcn already fit your stack; no extra deps beyond framer-motion (which you already use; if not, npm i framer-motion).

Optional backend (if you want to store results)

Create an endpoint like:

app.post("/api/riasec", isAuthenticated, async (req,res)=>{
  // persist { userId, ...req.body } to your DB
  res.status(201).json({ ok:true });
});
