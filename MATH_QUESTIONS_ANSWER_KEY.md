## Testing Instructions

### For 100% Math Score:

1. **Start Assessment**: Begin the career assessment
2. **Select Country**: Choose UAE (only country with questions)
3. **Choose Grade**: Select either:
   - Grades 8-9 (gets questions 1-20)
   - Grades 10-12 (gets questions 21-40)
4. **Subject Selection**: Select **Mathematics ONLY** (not Economics - it doesn't exist!)
5. **Take Quiz**: Answer all 20 questions with option **A**
6. **Expected Result**: 20/20 correct = **100% Mathematics strength**

### What About Economics?

Since Economics questions don't exist:
- If you select Economics, you'll get 0 questions or a "coming soon" message
- Your subject strength for Economics will be **N/A** or **0%**
- This is expected behavior - the question bank was never created

---

## Subject Strength Calculation

The system calculates subject strength as:

```
Subject Strength = (Correct Answers / Total Questions) × 100
```

For Math with all correct answers:
- **Grades 8-9**: 20/20 = 100%
- **Grades 10-12**: 20/20 = 100%

---

## Verification After Test

After completing the quiz, check your assessment results:

1. **Subject Competency Scores** should show:
   - ✅ Mathematics: **100%** (or 20/20)
   - ❌ Economics: **N/A** or **0%** (no questions)

2. **In Database** (`assessments` table):
   ```json
   {
     "subjectScores": {
       "Mathematics": 100
     }
   }
   ```

3. **In PDF Report**: Mathematics should appear as a top strength with perfect score
